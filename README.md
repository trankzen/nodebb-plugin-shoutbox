# NodeBB Tribune plugin

This it a fork of nodebb-plugin-shoutbox by Schamper. The goal is to provide a more IRC like interface with some additional functionality.

Some features I will first focus on :

- move the input to the top
- remove shout grouping by user
- add a hh:mm:ss timestamp and the username for every shout
- add a separator for each day
- show last N messages with an option to expand to the entire day
- enable archives
- enable search (with highlight)
- add the ability to view single shouts on a page of their own

This is a work in progress.
